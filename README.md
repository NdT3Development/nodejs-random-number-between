# Node.js Random Number Between

This is a simple module for Node.js made with the included Math functions of Node.js. Usage is simple and an example has been included.

## Usage
Example code:

```javascript
var randnum = require('./index.js');
var rand = randnum(1, 10, 5);
console.log(rand);
```
In the above example code, the first number in the second line (`var rand = randnum(1, 10, 5)`), the first number (`1`) is the minimum number, the second number (`10`) is the maximum number, and the third number (`5`) is the number of numbers to generate.
